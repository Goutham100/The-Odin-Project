        <h1>Apple Pie Recipe</h1>
        <p>To make an apple pie, start by preparing the pie crust or using a store-bought one. In a large bowl, mix peeled and sliced apples with sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, a pinch of salt, and a tablespoon of flour to thicken. Roll out the bottom pie crust and place it in a pie dish, filling it with the apple mixture. Dot the apples with small pieces of butter for extra richness. Roll out the second crust and place it over the filling, crimping the edges to seal. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Brush the top with an egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for about 50-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbly. Let the pie cool slightly before slicing and serving.</p>
